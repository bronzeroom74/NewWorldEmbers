What difference does it make how many limbs you have, what colour your skin is, or if you are even vaguely human?\nAll who are able to comprehend the Promethean teachings and carry the Red Flame in their hearts should be welcomed as comrades and be allowed to join in the glorious revolution.\n\nOpen the alcohol supply and double the rations this next week, for our Red Light shines upon tens of thousands of new Comrades\n§RUnto progress\nUnto Unity\nUnto Revolution!"

Let their blood water our fields, let their slaves be freed, and let their bones become the foundation upon which we'll build a new and freer world!"

All who accept Prometheism shall be rewarded, and while we are well aware that many will only adopt our ideology for an economic advantage, we are confident that in time they will come to be true believers.\n\nWith this great war concluded, the Emergency Command has dissolved itself and a new civilian government has been reinstated, staffed with representatives from all over this new Promethean Republic.\n\nWhile we are now undoubtedly one of the greatest powers in Europe, we will still have to be forever vigilant, for concerning reports tell of other great powers rising from the former Capitals of Paris and Berlin. With us in the middle, it seems inevitable that a new, even greater war is on the horizon.\nBut for now, we shall celebrate this victory!"
