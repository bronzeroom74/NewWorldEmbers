  son.1.t:0 "The Landsknect Devours"
  son.1.d:0 "Ever after the world ended, München stood, surviving and almost thriving in the apocalypse. But around the city arose a multitude of mercenary and raider groups, all thirsting for everything that München had. None would grow stronger than a mercanry group known as the 'Landsknect'. From the southern edge of Germany they have spared no blade nor bullet towards the march for München, devouring and intergrating all in their way. München knew they couldn't stand up to the Landsknect, but they fought anyway, even if it meant nothing. It took 3 months for the fighting to stop and the Landsknect to claim their prize. The Landsknect Devours, but even the strongest of beasts shouldn't eat too much."
