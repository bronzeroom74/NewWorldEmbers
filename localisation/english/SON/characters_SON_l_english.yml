  SON_frundsberg_name:0 "The Frundsberg"
  SON_frundsberg_desc:0 "Judge. The man who would become Frundsberg was once an officer in the Landsknecht. Was always good at making tactical choices. Took over and reorganized a stagnating Landsknect into the Sons of Frundsberg, taking on the moniker The Frundsberg. He chose two wildly different men to be his right and left hand, to try and balance out power."

  SON_hilmar_name:0 "Hilmar the Juror"
  SON_hilmar_desc:0 "Jury. Born in München before it was taken over by the Landsknecht, Hilmar grew up resenting the Landsknecht, but was forced into joining their ranks through threats on his family. While by no means a prodigy in combat or warfare, Hilmar knew how to rally others, as well as how to push their buttons, and no amount of beatings would change that. After The Frundsberg took over and restructured his new 'Sons of Frundsberg', he approached Hilmar with a weird request, to be his left hand, the Jury to his Judgement."

  SON_eisenherz_name:0 "Commander Eisenherz"
  SON_eisenherz_desc:0 "Executioner. Eisenherz was leader of one of the original groups absorbed by the Landsknecht.  History of Brutal Violence. Will die before he surrenders. After The Frundsberg took over and restructured his new 'Sons of Frundsberg', he approached Eisenharz with a weird request, to be his right hand, the Executioner of his Judgement."
