nf_rrc.1.d:0 "Many people in the nation these days did not recall the fall. Those who did were either shunned from society for how they looked, or were hooked up to life supports imported from America during the final days of Europe... of the Commonwealth.\n\nThe Middle East had wiped out a number of nations, either through bankrupty, or through the nations falling into chaos after their infrastructure could not support itself any longer. How ironic it was that a nation that was known only for warring with itself, that had only achieved peace for over a hundred years just a few short years ago, now fell into the worst war it possibly could have.\n\nAnd yet, as always, it was the rich who sought to benefit from these, using the commoner as a stepping stone to ensure their fine luxury shoes and imported Egyptian wool socks were not spoiled by the blood and oil they spilled. The Krupp company was one of these. Though it was approaching 500 years of existence, their trades had changed very little throughout the last hundred years, quickly swapping from steel production to arms production. Though they were criticized for their involvement in the Second World War, it made no difference who killed who, or even who won, so long as they had the money and resources to survive, even thrive, in the end.\n\nBut this was not the First World War, nor was it the Second. No, this truly was A War To End All Wars. Or so they thought. Despite nearly a decade of production, the company saw record losses alongside record production levels, losing tens, hundreds, millions of Euros simply to supply the war effort. But despite the initial greedy motivations of the corporate executives, somewhere in their minds, they knew they couldn't pull out of the war machine, for if they did, it would not only spell the end of Europe, but the end of everything.\n\nAnd yet they still failed. For in the year 2060, after 8 straight years of fighting, the unthinkable happened, as the Middle East's oil supplies finally ran out. Some suspected a nuclear detonation, others merely pointed to the massive resource use throughout the past 8 years. Whatever the reason was, the end had come for Europe. But not the end of Krupp. Through precocious American investors and involvements, a handful of European corporations had gotten involved in pooling a large supply of alternate energy resources for this very scenario. Chief among the American inventions was the fusion cell. And so it was, despite 6 years of civil war that wiped many nations off the face of the Earth, that the corporations found a lifeline in microfusion. It cost them much, but they would live."
