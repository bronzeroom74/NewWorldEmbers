  RHW_major_bruno_ernst_desc:0 "Every great leader must make sacrifices to preserve their identity of their people and what they represent. Major Bruno Ernst, a war hero and grizzled veteran, is one of those leaders. Born and raised amongst the remnants of the Unionswehr, Ernst was trained from the moment he could pick up a weapon, recruited into a youth organization in order to continue growing their numbers, he proved to be the brightest and more resilient out of the batch of cadets his remnant could gather. Overtime he swiftly became a ruthless yet efficient soldier amongst the Rheinwehr's forces, as well as being able to partake in various mercenary jobs from escorts to even bounty hunting. He quickly gained the respect of his comrades in arms after having completed over fifty missions for the Rheinwache, displaying great courage and ingenuity on the battlefield. He was soon promoted to Hauptmann, before then gaining the rank of Major after succeeding his last commanding officer after their untimely death. Ernst dedicated his leadership to preserving the traditions and standards that his successors have established before him, though following the defense of Frankfuria, he began to develop a fascination of the wastes and its people which has created a dilemma that haunts him to this day; Preservation of what Rheinwache truely stands for, or use their knowledge and resources to rebuild the wastes?"
  RRC_quartermaster_kruger_name:0 "Quartermaster Kruger"
  RRC_quartermaster_kruger_desc:0 "For a prewar artifact, such as Kurger, the old world goals doesnt just die off because your skin degrades. Quartermaster Kurger, first name unknown, grew up in the heavy industrial parts of the Ruhr before the war. He was raised underneath the shadow of his father, whom was a very successful plant manager and representative for Krupp Steel, in order to match his father in terms of success he immediately applied for a job underneath the same plant his father owned. Overtime he worked considerably hard before finally reaching the position of sub manager. Though tragedy unfortunately struck at the age of 30 when his father, now retired, passed away from an aggressive form of cancer induced by long term asbestos exposure. Devastated at the loss of his icon, Kurger did everything he did to maintain his style of work ethic and legacy he left behind even do everything he can to reduce the exposure of asbestos and other deadly chemicals. However he was not able to continue maintaining his plant following the great war, as an act of selflessness he got all of his employees to the lower levels of the plant leaving himself behind, forced to take cover within the smelting room of the factory floor. He survived the initial blast, only sustaining a mild concussion and a few burns though his agony was just beginning. When the embers settled he emerged to search for first aid, only to notice his skin seemingly began to melt as his body was degraded by the radiation, as what many call now ghoulification. He was able to survive however, managing to secure his plant from looters and the other wordly creatures affected by the radiation. He lost the concept of time while stuck in the plant, years went by until he went to search for his employees, only to find that 53 out of the hundred he had under his payroll had survived, all ghoulified just like him.  Many years past, eventually the resurgence of civilization lead to many more opportunities for him and his crew to get back to their old lives as if nothing had happened, eventually being the founding member for the Rhine River Company."
  SLD_duke_otto_schulz_name:0 "Duke Otto Schulz"
  SLD_duke_otto_schulz_desc:0 "The young duke never had it easy. Despite being born into a rather comfy lifestyle, the soon to be Duke Scholz grew up with little education and means to an end. He was the only child and only heir to the title of Duke of the Saarland, or at least what is left of it. He spent most of his childhood in a fallout shelter specifically designed for royalty, having been able to live most of his years without being exposed to wasteland. However following the collapse of the Lotharingian Empire, the Saar family used their wealth and influence to begin swaying settlements to their side, eventually establishing a provisional government before proclaiming the reestablishment of the Duchy of Saarland, where as they would immediately align with the southern Confederation in turn bringing more trade and settlement. During an escort back to their old estate, Scholz family were murdered by a group of renegades with their convoy looted as well. Fortunately the now young duke was able to escape unscathed. It was then the situation of his former homeland was revealed to him, the absolute carnage that spread across the waste like the plague. Having inherited the title of Duke, it is now up to him to uphold his familys legacy and protect his home from the ravaging wastes."
  STR_chancellor_leon_beck_name:0 "Chancellor Leon Beck"
  STR_chancellor_leon_beck_desc:0 "The position of Chancellor is not a position to take forgranted, many have came before and all were held to the same mind numbing standards and responsibilities one must undertake to protect the city of Frankfurt from the grasp of the wastes. Leon Beck was one of those individuals, having been born on the outskirts of the city into a family of opportunistic traders, Leon only knew struggle and little triumph, however, living under the shadows of wasteland traders and a young mind helped him comprehend the economy of the wastes, soon leading to him pursuing his own entrepreneurship. At the age of 21 he soon inherited his families trading company, with the rising amount of business within the Ruhr subregion, his business flourished gaining him much needed income and a shiny reputation. Soon at the age of 30 he settled his business in the city of Frankfurt though the city itself was not yet in its golden age, with crime throughout and living standards horrendous, Leon himself decided to make a run for the local Chancellor, which at the time had no great importance other than a mere local position. Though through his inevitable victory in the upcoming election, running essentially unopposed, he turned the position from a mere figurehead to an iron throne of great power, using his knowledge of economics and trade to transform the city into a tremendous beacon of trade and wealth, while also using the wealth accumulated to expand the territory of Frankfuria north and southward, as well as to fund basic and fundamental needs and services including local police."

  LOR_captian_gabriel_chevalier_desc:0 "Honor and valor has little meaning in the wasteland, but even the oldest of soldiers still remember the old world values, to whatever worth they have left. Gabriel Chevalier originally served as a free lance mercenary near the Berlin wastes before migrating west in search for more business. In turn he began to establish his own mercenary business within the Lotharigian territories. However, the local governance was not too happy for his unpredictable business practice within their borders and in turn sent him multiple ultimatums, which soon turned into threats, then into assassination attempts. Chevalier was able to withstand each assassination attempt, refusing to budge and even eliminating some of the paid bounty hunters. While the bureaucratic mentality of the Lotharigian regime was evidently aggrivated by Chevaliers ignorance, the king himself showed great interest in his skill for at the time his own forces were lacking in much need skill that Chevalier possessed. After the king caught word of the quarrels, almost all threats ceased and assassins recalled, instead the King offered a proposal to Chevalier, offering him a commanding spot within his own guardsmen regiment, the Kings Grenadiers. Gabriel was hesitant but took the offer anyways, becoming captain of the regiment. It was from there he began to make his mark, becoming a prominent and respected soldier, to serve as his king required. Though he lived to see the end of the nation and his king he swore to protect, sending him and his men into indefinite exile where as they would continue to attempt to restore the glory of the old world."
